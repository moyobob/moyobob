## Major Difficulties

* **UI Design.** The screens we have to make are far many as we expected.
* **The range covered by the project.** Situations like restaurant conflicts, menu conflicts, and designation of who pays for the meal are happening every day, and are we covering (possibly not happened so far) all situations? We concluded that we aim to cover everything possible, but considering these situations are happening all the time we first focus on the mandatory features to test the service early.
* **Role distributing.**

## Contributions

We altogether discussed what to cover in our project and what to write for the specification. Followings are the main writers of each section of the requirements and specifications:

* Project Abstract: Yeonghyeon Kim, Kangwook Lee
* Customer: Hyemin Kim
* Competitive Landscape: Hyemin Kim
* User Stories: Kangwook Lee, Yeonghyeon Kim, Hyemin Kim, Hyunsuk Choo
* UI Requirements drawing: Hyunsuk Choo

Sprint Report is written by Yeonghyeon Kim.
