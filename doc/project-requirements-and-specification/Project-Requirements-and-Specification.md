## Project Abstract

Students who spend most of the time in the CSE club room usually do not go to the school restaurant but order a delivery meal together. In circumstances where many people gather to eat together at the same place, problems like the following occur:

- How to gather people to eat together
  - Someone needs to have enough people("party") to eat together because one or two might be inefficient.
  - When Someone who is not in the CSE student room wants to join the party, he/she should ask the people in the room in advance.
- Choosing a restaurant and picking menus
  - Someone must search for the flyer to find the restaurant list.
  - Each person has a preferred and/or disliked restaurant and they have to choose a restaurant among them.
  - They must look at the flyer to get the information like the menus they can order, the cost they have to pay etc.
- Ordering by call
  - Someone has to ask every person's menu and inform to the restaurant.
- Payment
  - Each person has to remember what he/she ordered and how much he/she have to pay, and the person who paid for the entire meal has to retrieve some amount of money for every person.

Web service __Moyobob__ aims to offer services that ease the procedure of gathering people, choosing the restaurant and the menus, ordering foods, and collecting the bill, when people gather to eat delivery foods at the student room, the club room, the lab etc.

## Customer
- __Moyobob__ is a service for people who eat delivery foods everyday in SNU CSE student room. 
- But we also concern about scalability to other groups like other departments or circles. __Moyobob__ aims to be a service for everyone who would like to eat delivery foods together.
